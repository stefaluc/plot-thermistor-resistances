# plot-thermistor-resistances

plot.py creates matplotlib plots found in *./plots/* and uses the data from *./cals/* .

Whether or not there is a skew to the measurements in time can be seen from the plots. 

Plots were created as part of a larger project that involves Electronic Calibrations of UW - Madison SSEC's AERI (Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer).
